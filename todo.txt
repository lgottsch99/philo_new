TODO							

error returns
check valgring, helgrind, fsanitize


--tool=drd check

I HAVE: 
fork assign: own plus next
	even pick up left first , uneven right
	forced thinking for odd nr philos
	synced start 
	

---- Program Design; -----

main: 
	checks input
	init program + philos (but not yet creating threads)
	decides which case (0, 1, more philos)
	starts threads philos
	starts monitor
	waits for all (JOIN)
	free

each philo:
	waits until start time
	runs eat-sleep-think while sim not finished
	stops itself when full, if yes returns

monitor:
	waits until all threads running
	endlessly (as long as sim not finished by all philos being full) 
		checks if any philo should die, if yes sets sim to finished

TESTING

no one should die:

5 800 200 200		

6 800 200 200 		

5 600 150 150		

4 410 200 200     

100 800 200 200		

105 800 200 200		

200 800 200 200

5 800 200 200 7
no one should die, simulation should stop after 7 eats

4 410 200 200 10
no one should die, simulation should stop after 10 eats



one should die: 

1 800 200 200

4 310 200 100	why???

4 200 205 200
