---- Program Design; -----

main: 
	checks input
	init program + philos (but not yet creating threads)
	decides which case (0, 1, more philos)
	starts threads philos
	starts monitor
	waits for all (JOIN)
	free

each philo:
	waits until start time
	runs eat-sleep-think while sim not finished
	stops itself when full, if yes returns

monitor:
	waits until all threads running
	endlessly (as long as sim not finished by all philos being full) 
		checks if any philo should die, if yes sets sim to finished
